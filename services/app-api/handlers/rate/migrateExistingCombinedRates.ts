/**
 * This is a data migration function for the rates table.
 * During development of the feature, we changed the shape of its data.
 * This script will look at every entry in the table and,
 * if it is the old shape, recompute it from scratch and overwrite it.
 *
 * We should only need to run this twice: once in DEV, and once in VAL.
 * The API version that produced the old data shape was never active in PROD.
 *
 * Once this script has been run, delete it! It should be idempotent but
 * there is no need to keep it around. Be sure to delete the function from
 * app-api/serverless.yml as well.
